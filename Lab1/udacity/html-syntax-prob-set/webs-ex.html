            There is a simple reason why Web Developer is such a hot job right now.
            Put simply, what Web Developers do is create how we experience the web.
            If you proceed from the notion that every person who engages with the
            web would prefer a great experience, then you can say that everyone who
            engages with the web would prefer that a Web Developer have done a great job.
        </p>

        <p>
            Companies of course know this, so they hire Web Developers to ensure
            their sites provide great experiences. So, lots of websites and lots
            of users means lots of demand. LOTS of demand.

        <h2>How to Complete this Exercise</h2>

        <p>
            I want you to recreate your website to look identical to the mockup.
            Start by taking a few minutes to analyze the mockup.
            What text is changed? What images are there?
